## How is this different from Next.js?

<small>(Warning: Personal opinions ahead...)</small>

---

## Going to production

- SPA Mode
- (No) Static Site Generation
- No server components (yet!)
- Much easier self-hosting
- Bundling is just a vite plugin

---

## Common patterns out of the box

- Fetching data, handling concurrency
- Form Integration
- Navigation Blocker

---

## Open Source friendlier

- Development and communication more involved with their community
- Open Roadmap and public "sprint plannings" on YT
