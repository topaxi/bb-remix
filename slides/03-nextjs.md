## How is this different from Next.js?

- SPA Mode
- (No) Static Site Generation
- Much easier self-hosting
- Smaller API footprint
- Just a vite plugin
- Common patterns supported out of the box
  - Navigation Blocker
  - Fetching data, handling concurrency
- Open Roadmap and public "sprint plannings" on YT
