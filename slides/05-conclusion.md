## Conclusions

- Remix is a great framework and I'm looking forward to see what the future brings
  - Single Fetch will improve the data loading strategy even further
  - Loaders and Actions will be able to return React Server Components

---

## Conclusions

- Compared to my past three years of experience with Next.js, Remix has been a
  great experience and I would use it over Next.js in most projects.
- Overall less problems encountered (lucky?)
- Updates to newer versions since the beginning were completely painless

---

## Conclusions

- Given the low complexity of the project, I'm not sure I'd pick a complex
  frontend framework and might reconsider classic server side rendering and
  maybe something like htmx.
- Little to no benefit of server side rendering (until React Server
  Components?) for apps behind a login.
- Requires runtime, increases infrastructure complexity and point of failures
